Example 4 

We will now do a simple problem (Determining a voters age)  requiring an if and else statement.



age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age >= 18:
   print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
   print("You are not eligible to vote yet.")



Output
Enter your age: 24
You are eligible to vote.
