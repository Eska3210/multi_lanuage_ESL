Example 1


a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
Output
b is greater than a







In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33, and bis 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".
