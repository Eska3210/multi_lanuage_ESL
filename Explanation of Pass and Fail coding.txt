Explanation of Changes:
Pass/Fail Check:

In the process_student_results function, after calculating the average score, I added a check to see if the average score is greater than or equal to 60. If so, the student passes, and the message "Congratulations, you passed!" is added to the result. Otherwise, the message "Fail" is added.
Pass/Fail in CSV:

A new key, 'pass_fail', is added to the student_results dictionary, which contains the pass/fail message based on the average score.
CSV Output:

The CSV now includes a column called pass_fail to show whether the student passed or failed.
Example Output in student_results.csv:
After processing, your CSV will look like this:

mathematics
name, math, science, english, average, grade, math_grade, science_grade, english_grade, min_score, max_score, score_range, pass_fail
John, 85, 92, 88, 88.33, B, B, A, B, 85, 92, 7, Congratulations, you passed!
Jane, 70, 75, 65, 70.00, C, C, C, D, 65, 75, 10, Congratulations, you passed!
Jake, 50, 45, 55, 50.00, E, E, E, E, 45, 55, 10, Fail
Conclusion:
This updated code now not only calculates the average score and assigns grades but also checks whether the student passed or failed based on their average score and outputs the results, including pass/fail status, into a new CSV file.
